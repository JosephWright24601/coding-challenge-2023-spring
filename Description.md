# ACM Research Coding Challenge Description

The problem I set out to solve was finding any correlation between the different categories of star data.

3 Types of comparisons were made:
`1.) Luminosity vs Radius`
`2.) Star color vs Temperature`
`3.) Star type vs Radius`

I set out to make these comparisons using the Seaborn library and the Matplotlib library and creating graphs and charts utilizing them.
The conclusions I were able to make in the short amount of time was that:
`1.) There is no correlation between luminosity and radius.`
`2.) There is a bit of deviation, but not much, when it comes to the color of a star and how hot it is`
`3.) There is a fair correlation between the star type and the radius of the star.`
